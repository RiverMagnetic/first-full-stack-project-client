## Project Idea

My first full stack project idea is simple. It's a list app.

I love lists. I'm really excited about learning through my idea's simplicity, and the infinite possibilities for building upon it.

I am looking forward to building something I would want to use, and as I move beyond the MVP, I hope to appeal to other list lovers as well.


## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX, and interacts with an API I built. I plan to also use Handlebars, and might begin to implement other styling technologies such as SCSS and Bootstrap in early iterations.


## Planning

I decided to go with something simple for my first full-stack project, in order to balance trying to get this done in under a week with my other commitments. Luckily, simplcity doesn't have to mean boring, and can actually be a fun starting place from which to continue exploring and building!


I began by creating a schedule, and then writing user stories that matched the project requirements and my ideas for a first iteration. You can see both of these on the Trello board I made for this project: https://trello.com/b/sqkzgniO/list-project


I created wireframes which I will link to in this README soon.


## Development Process and Problem Solving

I like to set personal deadlines that would be a stretch to meet to keep myself motivated and challenged. General Assembly's suggested schedule for the project is really valuable, so I decided to make that the basis for my personal schedule, while attempting to finish the project in 3 days. I ended up with 27 of the 35 items on my schedule done in that time, but since the project was incomplete by the end of this deadline, in the second iteration of my schedule I honed in on requirements rather than putting learning first.

I began with my API. After getting most of the API items on my schedule done, I added HTML some rough CSS, and Javascript (including JQuery and AJAX) in order to add authentication features, one at a time.

When I ran into my one problem, I proactively posted an issue in the issue queue.
