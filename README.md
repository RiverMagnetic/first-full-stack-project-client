## Project Idea

My first full stack project idea is simple. It's a list app.

I love lists. I'm really excited about learning through my idea's simplicity, and the infinite possibilities for building upon it.

I am looking forward to building something I would want to use, and as I move beyond the MVP, I hope to appeal to other list lovers as well.


## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Sass, Handlebars, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX, and interacts with an API I built using Ruby on Rails and Postgresql (you can find the back end repo [here],(https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/first-rails-api-project), and [this](https://api-list-project.herokuapp.com/) will take you to the back end's live URL). 

## Planning

I decided to go with something simple for my first full-stack project, in order to balance trying to get this done in under a week with my other commitments. Luckily, simplcity doesn't have to mean boring, and can actually be a fun starting place from which to continue exploring and building!


I began by creating a schedule, and then writing user stories that matched the project requirements and my ideas for a first iteration. You can see both of these on the [Trello board I made for this project](https://trello.com/b/sqkzgniO/list-project).


I created wireframes, which will need to be updated as the project grows. You can see my original wireframes [here](https://github.com/RiverMagnetic/first-full-stack-project-client/blob/master/list-wireframe.jpg).


## Development Process and Problem Solving

I like to set personal deadlines that would be a stretch to meet to keep myself motivated and challenged. General Assembly's suggested schedule for the project is really valuable, so I decided to make that the basis for my personal schedule, while attempting to finish the project in 3 days. I ended up with 27 of the 35 items on my schedule done in that time, but since the project was incomplete by the end of this deadline, in the second iteration of my schedule I honed in on requirements rather than continuing to put learning first.

I began with my API. After getting most of the API items on my schedule done, I added HTML, some rough CSS, and Javascript (including JQuery and AJAX), in order to add the authentication features. Then I worked on displaying a list with handlebars, and finished my first iteration by working through the other CRUD actions necessary to edit the list.

When I ran into problems, I posted issues in the issue queue. 

## Problems I Plan to Solve in Future Iterations

1. Currently when the View List button is clicked, the response is tacked on to the list that is already displayed. I want to clear the contents before returning the list so that that doesn't happen. 
2. I also want to make my UI more intuitive, both in terms of where buttons are found, and messages are displayed. 
3. In general I want to work on my styling. The first part I plan to work on is how the items are displayed in the list.
