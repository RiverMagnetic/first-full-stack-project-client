## Project Idea

My first-full-stack-project idea is simple. It's a list app.

I love lists. I'm really excited about learning through my idea's simplicity, and the infinite possibilities for building upon it.

I am looking forward to building something I would want to use, and as I move beyond the MVP, I hope to appeal to other list lovers as well.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX, and interacts with an API that I built. I plan to also use Handlebars, and might begin to implement other styling technologies such as SCSS and Bootstrap in early iterations.
